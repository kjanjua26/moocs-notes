# moocs-notes :notebook:
The notes of various MOOCs that I took and continue to take over the years.

Following are the MOOCs/courses that I took and the notes I made which have been added to this repository. All of these notes are my own handwritten (either on paper, or digitally). I will provide a link to the course, where you can either watch the videos, go through the slides, to relate the notes with.

1. <span style="color:red">**alberta-birds-theropods**</span>: This is an introductory course to Paleontology, and is provided on Coursera. The course is *Theropod Dinosaurs and the Origin of Birds*, and the video lectures can be viewed from this link <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/theropods-birds">LECTURES</a>.
2. <span style="color:red">**nust-distributed-computing**</span>: This was my undergraduate course on Distributed Computing and since the lecture slides and recordings are not available, therefore I can only provide the written notes of the entire course. The notes are detailed so that should help.
3. <span style="color:red">**ubc-gaussian-processes**</span>: These are the notes of the lectures on GP, a course taught at UBC by Nando de Freitas. The video lectures + slides can be accessed from this link <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vGiHC35j9s&ab_channel=NandodeFreitas">LECTURES</a>.
