# moocs-notes :notebook:
The notes of various MOOCs that I took and continue to take over the years.

Following are the MOOCs/courses that I took and the notes I made which have been added to this repository. All of these notes are my own handwritten (either on paper, or digitally). I will provide a link to the course, where you can either watch the videos, go through the slides, to relate the notes with.
