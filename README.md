# moocs-notes :notebook:
The notes of various MOOCs that I took and continue to take over the years.

Following are the MOOCs/courses that I took and the notes I made which have been added to this repository. All of these notes are my own handwritten (either on paper, or digitally). I will provide a link to the course, where you can either watch the videos, go through the slides, to relate the notes with.

1. alberta-birds-theropods: This is an introductory course to Paleontology, and is provided on Coursera. The course is *Theropod Dinosaurs and the Origin of Birds*, and the video lectures can be viewed from this link <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/theropods-birds">LECTURES</a>.
2. nust-distributed-computing: This was my undergraduate course on Distributed Computing and since the lecture slides and recordings are not available, therefore I can only provide the written notes of the entire course. The notes are detailed so that should help.
3. ubc-gaussian-processes: These are the notes of the lectures on GP, a course taught at UBC by Nando de Freitas. The video lectures + slides can be accessed from this link <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vGiHC35j9s&ab_channel=NandodeFreitas">LECTURES</a>.
4. nust-natural-language-processing: This was my undergraduate course on Distributed Computing and since the lecture slides and recordings are not available, therefore I can only provide the written notes of the entire course. The notes are detailed so that should help.
5. sapienza-intro-ml: These are the notes of the graduate course in ML at Sapienza University of Rome. The slides + lectures can be accessed from here <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/diag.uniroma1.it/ml2019/">LECTURES</a>.
